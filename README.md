# Cestamos!

This is a college project in python and dart for the subject CES-28: Software Engineering Fundamentals, in ITA (Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica, Brazil). "Cestamos!" is an mobile app developed by five ITA students: Ariel Claudino ([`@asclaudino`](https://github.com/asclaudino)), Bernardo Hoffmann da Silva ([`@BerHoffmann`](https://github.com/BerHoffmann)), Emmanuel Dias ([`@emmanuelsdias`](https://github.com/emmanuelsdias)), Eric Guerra Ribeiro ([`@Eric-Guerra-Ribeiro`](https://github.com/Eric-Guerra-Ribeiro)) and Gabriel Gandour ([`@GaGandour`](https://github.com/GaGandour)).

## How to Execute

### By Cloning the Repos

After downloading the frontend's repository, download also the backend repository (which can be found at [cestamos_backend](https://github.com/emmanuelsdias/cestamos_backend).) To run the app, you first have to setup the backend by running `make start` command inside the `cestamos_backend` repo folder. After that, run the `make start` command inside the `cestamos_frontend` folder. 

### Or Downloading the App (soon?)

For now, the application is not available at the App Store nor the Play Store, due to deployment fees which were not sustainable in the long run. Any changes and this section will be updated =)

## The App

"Cestamos!" was inspired in grocery/shopping lists apps. In this app, you may create lists and share them with your friends. 

### Landing page : 

On this page, the user may login in their account by inserting their email and password. If they haven't registered already, they may do so by providing their name, email and password. 


### Lists page : 

On this page, the user may create lists, joining them alone or together with their friends. People in the list may add new items, check items bought or remove items permanently. Only list's admins may add/remove members to the list or grant/revoke admin's status.

### Friends page : 

On this page, the user may add friends by their `Id`, check their info (including their given `Id`) and accept/reject friend requests.


### Recipes page:

This page was not implemented. It was originally meant to be an recipe's feed in which they user may see recipes uploaded by their friends. Also, the user would be able to add the recipe's ingredients to one of their lists.

## Non-Code-Related Credits

### Graphic Art and Design

The "Cestamos!" visual identity was designed by Emmanuel Dias ([`@emmanuelsdias`](https://github.com/emmanuelsdias)) and the app's design was developed by the group basing it upon the visual identity.
